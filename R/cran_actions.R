## What are the times between archival and unarchival?

#' Look at the CRAN actions db

#' CRAN tracks movements of packages and the actions used (for example to report
#' the number of manual actions taken by the volunteers).
#' @inheritParams base_alias
#' @return A data.frame with Date, Time, User, Action, Package and Version columns.
#' @importFrom stats na.omit
#' @importFrom utils head
