The goal of repo.data is to make repository data accessible. Mainly it
consumes existing data but the idea is to also generate it.

When a function is specific of a repository it will start with its name:
`cran_` or `bioc_`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of repo.data like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("llrs/repo.data")
```

## Example

We can get a data.frame of all packages on CRAN archive:

``` r
library(repo.data)
ca <- cran_archive()
#> Warning: There are 7 packages both archived and published
#> This indicate manual CRAN intervention.
head(ca)
#>         Package            Datetime Version   User   Size   Status
#> 1            A3 2013-02-07 10:00:29   0.9.1 hornik  45252 archived
#> 2            A3 2013-03-26 19:58:40   0.9.2 ligges  45907 archived
#> 3            A3 2015-08-16 23:05:54   1.0.0 hornik  42810 archived
#> 4 AalenJohansen 2023-03-01 11:42:11     1.0 ligges 165057  current
#> 5       aamatch 2025-06-24 11:40:05   0.3.7 ligges 222104  current
#> 6          aaMI 2005-06-24 17:55:17   1.0-0   root   2968 archived
```

We can also check CRAN comments about the packages on its archive:

``` r
cc <- cran_comments()
#> Retrieving comments, this might take a bit.
#> Caching results to be faster next call in this session.
head(cc)
#>    package
#> 1       A3
#> 2    aaSEA
#> 3      aba
#> 4   abbyyR
#> 5   abcADM
#> 6 abcdeFBA
#>                                                                          comment
#> 1         Archived on 2025-06-13 as issues were not corrected despite reminders.
#> 2 Archived on 2022-06-21 as check problems were not corrected despite reminders.
#> 3           Archived on 2022-03-27 as check problems were not corrected in time.
#> 4                            Archived on 2023-11-03 at the maintainer's request.
#> 5                   Archived on 2023-03-02 as issues were not corrected in time.
#> 6           Archived on 2022-03-07 as check problems were not corrected in time.
#>         date   action
#> 1 2025-06-13 archived
#> 2 2022-06-21 archived
#> 3 2022-03-27 archived
#> 4 2023-11-03 archived
#> 5 2023-03-02 archived
#> 6 2022-03-07 archived
```

Or estimate the last date of update of our packages, by the information
on the session info or a data.frame:

``` r
cran_session(session = sessionInfo())
#> Warning in cran_archive(versions[, "Package"]): Omitting packages repo.data.
#> Maybe they were not on CRAN?
#> [1] "2025-06-18"
ip <- installed.packages()
cran_date(ip)
#> Warning in cran_archive(versions[, "Package"]): Omitting packages repo.data, airway, alabaster.base, alabaster.matrix, alabaster.ranges, alabaster.sce, alabaster.schemas, alabaster.se, annotate, AnnotationDbi, AnnotationFilter, AnnotationHub, assorthead, Biobase, BiocFileCache, BiocGenerics, BiocIO, BioCor, BiocParallel, BiocPkgTools, BiocStyle, BiocVersion, biocViews, biomformat, Biostrings, cransays, DelayedArray, DESeq2, ensembldb, ExperimentHub, fgsea, GenomeInfoDb, GenomeInfoDbData, GenomicAlignments, GenomicFeatures, GenomicRanges, GO.db, GOSemSim, GSEABase, gypsum, h5mread, HDF5Array, IRanges, KEGGREST, MatrixGenerics, microshades, org.Hs.eg.db, phyloseq, preprocessCore, ProtGenerics, reactome.db, resios, rhdf5, rhdf5filters, Rhdf5lib, Rhtslib, rostemplate, rotemplate, Rsamtools, rtracklayer, rutils, S4Arrays, S4Vectors, scRNAseq, SingleCellExperiment, SparseArray, SummarizedExperiment, UCSC.utils, XVector.
